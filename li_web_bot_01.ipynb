    "### Description:\n",
    "- This code creates the framework for a web-bot that allows the input of a Linkedin article. The bot then navigates to that article, scrapes the relevant information and then submits a comment on that article. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Warning!\n",
    "-  This code is not a simple plug-and-play. A web bot has certain requirement, once we complete these requirements, we can move on to running the code.\n",
    "-  Im assuming that you already have installed python, here we are using python version 3.9.13\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps:\n",
    "1. Install selenium (I prefer version 3.141.0) using pip\n",
    "    - pip3 install selenium==3.141.0\n",
    "2. You will need the gecko driver which you can get here:\n",
    "    - https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases/download/v0.28.0/geckodriver-v0.28.0-win64.zip\n",
    "3. Install Firefox\n",
    "    - https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new\n",
    "4. Create a new directory\n",
    "    - place the gecko driver that you downloaded in that directory\n",
    "5. You will then need to create a custom firefox profile to be used by your web-bot\n",
    "    - This step is vital, if you are not using the same profile each time you run your script, it is like you are running in incognito mode each time. A consistent profile allows you to get past the bot-checks and dual authentication. \n",
    "    - Press (windows-key) + R, open 'firefox.exe -p' and follow steps.. place created profile in the directory you made in step 4.\n",
    "    - https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profile-manager-create-remove-switch-firefox-profiles\n",
    "    - You should then see a folder titled 'tsenysae.default-release' in the directory you created in step 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you followed those steps, you should be ready to go (minus the AI part, that requires an API key and adding funds to your account)\n",
